        <h3>1980s</h3>
        <P>The 1980s had so many amazing wrestlers. It was the time of good guys and bad guys. Hulk Hogan was on top of the world. Mr T was alive and well. You had people like Dusty Rhodes and Randy Savage. Miss Elizabeth. The British Bulldogs. What a time to be alive.</P>
        <h4>WWF</h4>
        <p>Vince McMahon was at an all time high, buying every territory he could get his stinky paws on. Plus dont forget all the celebrities he brough out. From Muhammad Ali to Liberace. The 1980s were truly a special time.</p>

        <h3>1980s</h3>
        <p>The 1980s had some amazing bad guys. From Rowdy Roddy Piper and his coconut smashing ways, to the terrifying Giant that was Andre. Jake the Snake with his burlap sack. King Kong Bundy, The Iron Sheik, Nikolai Volkoff. Plus who could ever forget the man that was Nature Boy Ric Flair. 16 time champion dont you know.</p>
        <h4>Women</h4>
        <P>There are so many female wrestlers over the years. Sable, Terry Runnel, just to name a few. Remember when goldust used to wear that long wig. That was weird. Man, wrestling sure was interesting back in the day. La La LA.

        <h4>Men</h4>
        <p>I once knew a man named Cleve, he didnt like to be called Steve. He went to the bank, met a man named Frank and one day learnt how to read. I once knew a man named Jed. He never ever got out of bed. One day his cat, sat on his lap, and next thing you know he was dead.I once knew a man named Jake. He had a giant poisonous snake. He went on a date, with a woman named Kate and next thing you know he was dead. La La La. Type type type. </p>
